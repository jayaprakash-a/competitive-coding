# Problem Statement

Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a 
thermometer and it came out to be $X$ °F. 

A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is **strictly greater** 
than $98$ °F.

Determine if Chef has fever or not.

# Constraints

- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $94 \le X \le 103$

# Format

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. 
  Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $X$ - the body 
  temperature of Chef in °F.


## Output

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef has fever. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase 
(for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

# Sample Testcases

## Sample Test 1

**Input:**
3
98
100
96


**Output:**
NO
YES
NO


**Explanation:**
**Test Case 1**: Since $X = 98$ is not greater than $98$, Chef does not have fever.

**Test Case 2**: Since $X = 100$ is greater than $98$, Chef has fever.

**Test Case 3**: Since $X = 96$ is not greater than $98$, Chef does not have fever.
