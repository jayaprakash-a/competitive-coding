# Problem Statement

Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME21/mandarin/LUCKFOUR.pdf)  and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME21/russian/LUCKFOUR.pdf).

Kostya likes the number **4** much. Of course! This number has such a lot of 
properties, like:

* Four is the smallest composite number;
* It is also the smallest Smith number;
* The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;
* Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;
* There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more 
  than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the 
  same color;
* Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be 
  written as the sum of at most four square numbers;
* Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;
* In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;
* And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!

Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences 
of four anywhere. He has a list of **T** integers, for each of them he wants to 
calculate the number of occurrences of the digit **4** in the decimal 
representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.

# Constraints

* **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **10<sup>5</sup>**
* (Subtask 1): **0** <= Numbers from the list <= **9** - 33 points.
* (Subtask 2): **0** <= Numbers from the list <= **10<sup>9</sup>** - 67 points.

# Format

## Input

The first line of input consists of a single integer **T**, denoting the number 
of integers in Kostya's list.

Then, there are **T** lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.

## Output

Output **T** lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences 
of the digit **4** in the respective integer from Kostya's list.
