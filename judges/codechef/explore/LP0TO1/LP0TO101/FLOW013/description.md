# Problem Statement

Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three 
angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all 
the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

# Constraints

* 1 **≤** **T** **≤** 1000
* 1 **≤** **A,B,C** **≤** 180

# Format

## Input

The first line contains an integer **T**, the total number of testcases. Then 
**T** lines follow, each line contains three angles **A**, **B** and **C**, of 
the triangle separated by space. 

## Output

For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is 
not, in a new line.

# Sample Testcases

```markdown
**Input**

3 
40 40 100
45 45 90
180 1 1

**Output**
