# Problem Statement

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to 
read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the 
**enormous Input/Output** warning. You are expected to be able to process at 
least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

# Format

## Input

The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k <= 10<sup>7</sup>). The 
next n lines of input contain one positive integer t<sub>i</sub>, not greater 
than 10<sup>9</sup>, each.

## Output

Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers t<sub>i</sub> are 
divisible by k.

# Sample Testcases

## Sample Test 1

**Input:**
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11


**Output:**
4

**Explanation:**
The integers divisible by $3$ are $51, 966369, 9,$ and $999996$. Thus, there 
are $4$ integers in total.
