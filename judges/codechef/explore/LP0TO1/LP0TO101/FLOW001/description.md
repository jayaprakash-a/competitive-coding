# Problem Statement

```
Every problem starts with a Problem Statement. It tells you in detail about 
the task to be solved.
```

Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. 
Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.

The task is very simple: given two integers A and B, write a program to add 
these two numbers and output it.

# Constraints

This section tells you the maximum and minimum possible values the variables in 
the problem statement can take. You <b>do not</b> need to check these 
constraints in your program. You can safely assume that the input given to your 
program will be in the given range of constraints. 

- 1 <= **T** <= 1000
- 0 <= **A,B** <= 10000

# Format

## Input

```
This section tells you the format in which your program should receive the input.
```

The first line contains an integer **T**, the total number of test cases. Then 
follow **T** lines, each line contains two Integers **A** and **B**.

## Output

```
This section tells us the format in which your program should give the output
```

For each test case, add **A** and **B** and display the sum in a new line.

```
Everything your program prints is considered "output", so if you output some 
debugging statements like "Please enter T", this will be considered as part of 
your answer, and because it does not satisfy the output format, it will be 
marked wrong, even if your answer is otherwise correct!
```
